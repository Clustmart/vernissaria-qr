Security Issues
1. External API Dependency
Issue: The plugin relies on an external service (https://vernissaria.qraft.link/generate) to generate QR codes.
Risk: If this external service is compromised or goes offline, your plugin functionality breaks or could potentially be used as an attack vector.
Improvement: Consider implementing a local QR code generator using a WordPress-compatible library instead of relying on an external service. If you must use the external service, implement better validation of the returned data.
2. Insufficient Response Validation
Issue: The plugin checks only the first 8 bytes to verify if the response is a PNG.
Risk: This minimal validation could allow malicious content to be saved as a PNG file.
Improvement: Implement more thorough validation of the received image data and consider using WordPress functions like wp_check_filetype() for additional validation.
3. Direct File Operations
Issue: Using file_put_contents() directly for creating .htaccess files.
Risk: This bypasses WordPress file operation abstraction which could cause permission issues.
Improvement: Use WordPress Filesystem API for all file operations.
4. Missing Rate Limiting
Issue: No limits on how many QR codes can be generated.
Risk: Could lead to abuse or excessive API calls.
Improvement: Implement rate limiting for QR code generation.
5. No Error Logging
Issue: The plugin doesn't log failures or errors.
Risk: Makes debugging difficult and could hide security issues.
Improvement: Add proper error logging for failed API calls or file operations.
6. Potential Query Performance Issues
Issue: Some database queries load all posts with no limit.
Risk: Could cause performance problems on sites with many posts.
Improvement: Paginate results and use more efficient queries, especially in the dashboard widget.
